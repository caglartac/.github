One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science is to facilitate knowledge discovery by assisting humans and machines in the discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of scientific data and associated software. 
FAIR is a set of guiding principles to make data and software **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**.  
The term FAIR was launched at a [Lorentz workshop](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2014/602/info.php3?wsid=602) in 2014, the resulting FAIR principles were first published in 2016.
Version 1.0 was published in 2022 by the [FAIR4RS Working Group of the Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg)

**To be Findable:**

F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
F2. data are described with rich metadata.
F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.
F4. metadata specify the data identifier.

**To be Accessible:**

A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.
A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.
A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.
A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

**To be Interoperable:**

I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

**To be Re-usable:**

R1. (meta)data have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.
R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.
